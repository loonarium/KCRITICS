    <p>Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die.</p>
    <p>No guns, no killing.</p>
    <p>Do I really look like a guy with a plan?</p>
    <p>Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?</p>
    <p>Your Punishment Must Be More Severe.</p>
    <p>No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an idel and if they can't stop you then you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.</p>
    <p>Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.</p>
    <p>You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.</p>
    <p>I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.</p>
    <p>You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.</p>
    <p>They scream and they cry much as you're doing now.</p>
    <p>I just want my phone call.</p>
    <p>Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.</p>
  	<p>It's ends here.</p>
